  Our project is the popular game minesweeper, but with a twist. Like usual, 
  Deep Minesweeper displays a grid where clicking on a box displays the number 
  of mines in adjacent blocks. However, Deep Minesweeper has 3 dimensions and 
  therefore this number also includes adjacent mines on other layers. Therefore,
  if you believe a box has mine, it should be dug out rather than flagged so 
  that you can view the blocks beneath it. You must be careful as you can only
  dig up the number of blocks equal to the total number of mines. Each layer has
  a different color, that way the user can tell which layer each box is in.
